        <h3>By: Kayzlee Butler</h3>
          <p>Arches National Park, for its size, has more natural holes in rocks than anywhere in the world. Over 2,000 arches and windows, as well as many delicately carved pinnacles, spires, and strangely shaped rocks, make up the scenery in this land of red rocks. Delicate Arch is the most well known arch. Landscape Arch, located at Devils Garden, stretches over 300 feet in length and is one of the largest arches in North America. Other interesting places in the park include Courthouse Towers, Balanced Rock, Fiery Furnace, and The Windows Section.</p></td>

        <h3>When to visit Arches National Park</h3>
        <p>Arches may be hot and dry, but it’s as popular as the captain of the football team in an ’80s movie. That means crowds, so plan your trip wisely. If you’re driving, try visiting between 7 and 8 in the morning or 3 to 5 at night. Temperatures are cooler then and you’ll feel cool just for planning ahead. “My, what moderate weather we’re having,” people who aren’t at Arches are known to say. In the lingo of nature documentary one-liners, this is a land of extremes: Temps can boomerang 40 degrees from day to night here and summer highs can reach well over 100 degrees. Plus, there are the late-summer monsoons to contend with. So if you come from pale potato-farmer stock or have a reaction to withering heat (anyone? anyone?) it’s best to visit in early spring or fall, when the weather cleans up its act a bit and pretends that this time, it has really changed for good. If you do go in summer, check the forecast before you go — for heat and for monsoon rain. If you go in winter, expect highs between 30 to 50 degrees and nighttime lows of 0 to 20 degrees. In other words, bundle up, put on your moon boots and pin a note to your back in case your brain freezes and you forget your way back to the car.</p>
