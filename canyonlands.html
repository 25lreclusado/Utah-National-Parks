          <h3>By: Kayzlee Butler</h3>
          <p>The whole park is a redrock woodcut engraved by wind’s and water’s big, slow chisels. The Green and Colorado Rivers trisect the Colorado Plateau, etching Canyonlands into distinct districts. The mesas you see at Island in the Sky look like a mountain range lopped off by a broadsword. The Maze is gorges, gorgeously gouged. Needles is a pincushion, pointy-sides-out. Chopped buttes, scored sediment and carved petroglyphs. Lots of sculpting, scraping and dividing asunder.</p></td>

      <h3>When to visit Canyonlands National Park</h3>
      <p>Canyonlands is a desert, but it’s a high desert, which means that things can get cold and temps can swing 40 degrees in a single day. So know before you go: Check the weather report, bring layers and plan your trip in advance.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Winter:</b>  While it rarely snows in Canyonlands proper, winter temps rarely top 50 when the sun’s out and dip close to zero some nights. Beware of all snowfalls, since even a light flurry can make many trails impassable. Unless you’re a robot designed to perform in cold and on ice, in which case, knock yourself out.</li>
        <li><b>Spring:</b> April and May are perfect times to visit the park, with highs from 60 to 80 degrees and lows from 30 to 50 degrees.</li>
        <li><b>Summer:</b> Summers in Canyonlands tend to be scorchers, bringing temps over 100 degrees and late summer monsoons with the threat of flash floods. Check the forecast before you go, bring plenty of water and don’t exercise strenuously. Remember, even rainfall in other areas can cause floods where you are, so keep a wide eye.</li>
        <li><b>Fall:</b> September and October vie with spring for best weather, with similar day and evening temperatures and that amiable, come-hither sunniness.</li>
      </ul>
