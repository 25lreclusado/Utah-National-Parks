        <p>Crowning the grand staircase, Cedar Breaks sits at over 10,000 feet and looks down into a half-mile deep geologic amphitheater. Come wander among timeless bristlecone pines, stand in lush meadows of wildflower, ponder crystal-clear night skies and experience the richness of our subalpine forest.</p></td>

      <h3>Indoor Activities:</h3>
      <p>We're working on several new indoor experiences at Cedar Breaks National Monument.</p>
      <p>Coming Soon! The National Park Service and Zion Forever Project are working with partners and supporters to enhance the view at Cedar Breaks National Monument and bring a new home for visitors at the park. The facility will serve the needs of the visitors in an efficient and sustainable way through modest design limiting the impact on the parkâ€™s dramatic landscape. Construction is expected to last two years.</p>

      <h3>Winter Access:</h3>
      <p>Cedar Breaks National Monument is open year-round, though accessing the park changes with the seasons. Beginning around mid-November each year, Highway 148 and the scenic road through the park (Rim Road) are closed due to snowfall. Highway 143 which enters the park at the north and east entrances is plowed during daylight hours during the winter. These conditions continue until mid to late May each year.

There are three primary locations to park when accessing the park during the winter. The two primary parking areas provide access for all users including snowshoers, cross-country skiers, and snowmobilers.</p>
