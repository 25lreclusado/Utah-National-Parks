          <h3>By: Kayzlee Butler</h3>
        <p>Dinosaur National Monument, straddling the border of Colorado and Utah, is notable for the abundance of dinosaur fossils that have been found on its grounds. There are also many outdoor activities at Dinosaur, such as hiking, camping and river rafting on the Green River. The Quarry Visitor Center has been closed since 2006 due to major structural problems and is slated to reopen in 2011. A temporary visitor center is setup nearby. Dinosaurs once roamed here. Their fantastic remains are still visibly embedded in the rocks. Today, the mountains, desert, and untamed rivers flowing in deep canyons support an array of life. Petroglyphs hint at earlier cultures. Later, homesteaders and outlaws found refuge here. Whether your passion is science, adventure, history or scenery, Dinosaur offers much to explore.</p></td>
