        <h3>By Leia Reclusado</h3>
          <p>One of the natural wonders of the world, the bridge has been formed by erosion of the sandstone by water flowing from Navajo Mountain towards the Colorado River. The bridge was officially "discovered" by the Douglas-Cummings surveyor party in 1909. Until the formation of Lake Powell, the bridge was several miles up Bridge Canyon from the shores of the Colorado River, and it was one of the most remote and inaccessible regions in the United States. Today, the shores of Lake Powell, which flooded Glen Canyon, now bring boaters to its base.
