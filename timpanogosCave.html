          <p>See formations called draperies, popcorn, helicities, and flowstone, as well as the more well-known stalactites and stalagmites. Water trickling down an inclined ceiling forms draperies, most less than one inch thick.
            Popcorn is made by water entering rock's pores or seeping down rock walls, leaving a bumpy surface.
            The most colorful and delicate formations in the caves, helicities, are like hollowed straws through which water traveled and left a small crystal deposit at the end. The colors of the rock are varied by iron, nickel, manganese, and other minerals.</p></td>
