          <p>A bajillion years ago, ancient iterations of the Virgin River started wreaking havoc on southwestern Utah. Now there’s a faint “You’re welcome” echoing through the canyons of Zion National Park. Zion National Park is like the set of a movie that’s so grand you know it’s fake, but you don’t care because it’s delicious to look at; the kind of flick where the art director was given carte blanche and didn’t worry about believability.Zion National Park is located in southern Utah near the city of Springdale, not far from Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, or St. George.</p></td>

      <h3>When to visit Zion</h3>
      <p>Don’t let the weather gods rain on your parade… err, family vacation. We’ve broken down what to expect season by season and thrown in some flash flood warnings, as well.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Spring:</b> If spring makes you think of bunnies, chicks and flowers, think again. Zion is a vision in March, April and May but it’s still a place where anything can happen. Warm, sunny weather is the norm (rarely over 90 degrees) but it can get rainy on a dime. Temps also vary with elevation and time of day — the swing between noon and midnight can reach 30 degrees. The wet weather peaks in March, but the snowmelt and high water levels last until May. Dress in layers.</li>
        <li><b>Summer:</b> In the summer months, Zion gets hot enough to fry a whole omelette on the trail, with temps regularly surpassing 100 degrees. From July to September, the monsoon season is in full swing, surprising visitors with thunderstorms, lightning and heavy rain. Bring clothes for all kinds of weather conditions and check the weather report like nobody’s business — flash floods are no joke and they can build from even a small amount of precipitation.</li>
        <li><b>Fall:</b> Fall is Zion’s golden season. Literally. Temps cool down, the monsoons let up and the trees go full Bob Ross with color. It’s a great time to visit the park, but stay alert: check the weather to steer clear of flash floods and make sure the river’s warm enough to wade in without consequence. If you have any questions, ask a park ranger. And remember, layers are a hiker’s best friend.</li>
        <li><b>Winter:</b> Two words: cold and wet. Zion is beautiful in the winter, but rain is a regular feature and the nights often dip below freezing. Snow tends to accumulate in the upper elevations but melts quickly on the valley floor. Park employees plow the roads, but some of the trails are closed depending on weather conditions. In late winter, melting snow makes the Virgin River into a swift, angry force of nature, so be careful.</li>
      </ul>
